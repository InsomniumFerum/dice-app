# GAME RULES

1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
3. BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
4. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

## Additional Rules

1. A player looses their ENTIRE score when he rolls two double 6 in row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
2. The player will loose their current score when one of the dice is a 1. After that, it's the next player's turn.
